<h1>Overview</h1>
The Crop Recommendation System aims to enhance crop production and sustainability in agriculture by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. This system provides accurate and tailored crop recommendations based on site-specific parameters, helping farmers optimize agricultural practices and maximize yield production.
<br>
<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
Accurate crop yield prediction is crucial for farmers to make informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and resource allocation. Traditional methods, reliant on farmer expertise and environmental observations, are increasingly unreliable due to climate change and weather variability. Farmers struggle to understand how factors like temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil quality, and pests impact yields. Modern agricultural complexity and the vast data generated further complicate prediction efforts. Manual data collection is time-consuming and insufficient for real-time decision-making. Therefore, advanced machine learning techniques are needed to integrate data from sources like satellite imagery, weather stations, soil sensors, and historical yield data. These techniques will provide accurate, actionable predictions to help farmers optimize practices, minimize risks, and enhance productivity.

<h1>Aim</h1>
Enhance crop production and sustainability in agriculture by leveraging the ensemble model with XGBoost, Random Tree, and Naive Bayes techniques to recommend crops based on site-specific parameters with high accuracy and efficiency.
Create a sophisticated online application that uses HTML and CSS to provide farmers with useful information. Implement advanced machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine to forecast crop prices accurately.
